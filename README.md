# Estimation
Estimation algorithm development and testing

Implementation of navigation algorithms for generalized on-line machine learning and state estimation. Project goal is to include dynamic model agnostic implementations of linear Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, and particle filter.
